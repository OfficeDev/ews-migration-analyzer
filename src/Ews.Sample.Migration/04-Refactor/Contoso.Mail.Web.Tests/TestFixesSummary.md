# Test Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the broken tests after implementing the Graph API IEmailService.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Ambiguous EmailMessage References

**Problem**: Tests were using both `Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.EmailMessage` and the new domain model `Contoso.Mail.Models.EmailMessage`, causing ambiguous reference errors.

**Solution**: 
- Updated all test files to use the domain model `Contoso.Mail.Models.EmailMessage`
- Added type aliases where needed: `using DomainEmailMessage = Contoso.Mail.Models.EmailMessage;`
- Updated helper classes to return domain model types instead of EWS types

**Files Modified**:
- `Contoso.Mail.Web.Tests/Controllers/MailControllerTests.cs`
- `Contoso.Mail.Web.Tests/Controllers/MailControllerFocusedTests.cs`
- `Contoso.Mail.Web.Tests/Helpers/MailControllerTestHelper.cs`

### 2. Graph API Test Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Graph SDK tests were using deprecated request configuration types and incorrect ServiceException constructor calls.

**Solution**:
- Updated to use generic `RequestConfiguration<T>` types instead of deprecated specific configuration classes
- Fixed ServiceException constructor calls to use proper overloads
- Updated NSubstitute calls to use proper `ThrowsAsync` extension methods
- Added necessary `using` statements for Microsoft.Kiota.Abstractions

**Files Modified**:
- `Contoso.Mail.Web.Tests/Services/GraphEmailServiceTests.cs`

### 3. Helper Class Type Mismatches

**Problem**: The `MailControllerTestHelper` was configured to return EWS types instead of domain model types.

**Solution**:
- Updated `SetupSuccessfulEmailRetrieval` method to work with `IList<DomainEmailMessage>`
- Added helper method `CreateSampleEmailMessage` for creating test domain model instances
- Fixed all method signatures to use domain model types

### 4. Async/Await Warning

**Problem**: One test was calling an async method without awaiting it, causing a compiler warning.

**Solution**:
- Added `await` keyword to the async verification call in `MailControllerFocusedTests`

## Test Coverage Maintained

All existing test scenarios are preserved and working:

? **Controller Tests**:
- User authentication scenarios
- ViewBag property verification
- Exception handling (MSAL, Identity Web, General exceptions)
- Model validation
- Email service interaction verification

? **Graph Service Tests**:
- Email retrieval from inbox
- Email retrieval by ID
- Reply model creation
- Reply sending
- Error handling for Graph API exceptions
- Service exception scenarios

? **Helper Class Tests**:
- User context setup variations
- Email service mocking scenarios
- Verification methods for logging and service calls

## Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**: All tests now use strongly-typed domain models instead of external library types
2. **Future-Proof**: Tests are independent of EWS library implementation details
3. **Consistency**: Both EWS and Graph implementations use the same test patterns
4. **Modern SDK Support**: Graph tests work with the latest Microsoft Graph SDK

## Test Execution

All tests now compile and can be executed successfully:

```bash
dotnet test Contoso.Mail.Web.Tests
```

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage for both email service implementations (EWS and Graph API) while maintaining clean separation of concerns and type safety.
