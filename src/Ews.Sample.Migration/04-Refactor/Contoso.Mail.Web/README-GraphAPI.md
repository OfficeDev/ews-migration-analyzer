# IEmailService Graph API Implementation

This implementation provides a Microsoft Graph API alternative to the existing Exchange Web Services (EWS) implementation.

## Implementation Summary

? **Completed:**
- Created `GraphEmailService` class implementing `IEmailService` interface
- Implemented all required methods using Microsoft Graph API
- Created domain model `Contoso.Mail.Models.EmailMessage` to abstract away implementation details
- Updated `EwsEmailService` to use the same domain model
- Updated Views and Controllers to use domain model
- Added configuration-based service selection
- Created comprehensive documentation

? **Key Features:**
- **Drop-in replacement**: Same `IEmailService` interface as EWS implementation
- **Domain model abstraction**: Uses `Contoso.Mail.Models.EmailMessage` instead of EWS types
- **Configuration-driven**: Switch between EWS and Graph using `appsettings.json`
- **Proper error handling**: Handles Graph API exceptions appropriately
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Configuration

### Switch to Graph API

Update `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "EmailService": {
    "UseGraphApi": true
  }
}
```

### Azure AD Setup

Ensure your Azure AD app registration has the required permissions:
- `Mail.Read`
- `Mail.ReadWrite` 
- `Mail.Send`

## Usage

The implementation is transparent to consuming code:

```csharp
public class MailController : Controller
{
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    public MailController(IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService; // Could be EWS or Graph implementation
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        var emails = await _emailService.GetInboxEmailsAsync(userEmail, 10);
        return View(emails);
    }
}
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Services/GraphEmailService.cs` - Graph API implementation
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Models/EmailMessage.cs` - Domain model
- `Contoso.Mail.Web.Tests/Services/GraphEmailServiceTests.cs` - Unit tests
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Docs/GraphApiImplementationGuide.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files:
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Services/IEmailService.cs` - Updated to use domain model
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Services/EwsEmailService.cs` - Updated to use domain model
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Views/Mail/Index.cshtml` - Updated for domain model
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Controllers/MailController.cs` - Updated for domain model
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/Program.cs` - Added Graph service configuration
- `Contoso.Mail.Web/appsettings.json` - Added Graph settings

## Authentication Note

The current Graph API setup uses basic authentication. For production use, you'll need to implement proper token acquisition using Microsoft Identity Web with the Graph SDK.

## Testing

The Graph API implementation includes comprehensive unit tests. The EWS tests have been updated to work with the new domain model.

## Migration Benefits

1. **Future-proof**: Graph API is Microsoft's modern API platform
2. **Better performance**: REST-based API with efficient querying
3. **Cross-platform**: Works on all platforms supported by .NET
4. **Modern authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with granular scopes
5. **Rich ecosystem**: Extensive SDK and tooling support

## Next Steps

1. Complete authentication setup for Graph API
2. Add integration tests
3. Implement retry logic for resilience
4. Add caching for performance optimization
5. Consider implementing webhooks for real-time updates
