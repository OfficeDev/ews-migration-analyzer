# 00-Baseline for Contoso Mail Sample Application

## Overview

This folder contains a simple mail application built with ASP.NET MVC that uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) to view and reply to recent emails for an authenticated M365 user. It serves as the baseline for the migration.

## Next Steps

1. Improve observability and local dev experience by adding Aspire to the application.
1. Add UI tests using Playwright to ensure changes we make to the applications do not affect functionality and user experience
1. Improve understanding of the codebase by using GitHub Copilot to generate code comments
